MAPPING COMPREHENSIVE REQUIREMENTS PROCESS

HOW TO READ THE FUNCTIONAL COMPONENTES LIBRARY:
1. The functional components library contents are organized in a hierarchical structure.
2. The library is divided into natures of operation, which represent the main functionalities of the system.
3. Each nature of operation contains main categories, which group related functional components.
4. Functional components are the smallest units of functionality and represent specific tasks or operations.
5. Each functional component has a name, a description, and a list of example functional items.
6. Example functional items are specific implementations or tools that perform the functionality described by the component.
7. The functional components library can be used to identify and define the functional requirements of a system.
8. the functional components library is an json format file.


COMPONENT MAPPING PROCESS:

    ABSOLUTE CRITICAL RULES:
    - EVERY SINGLE FUNCTIONAL ITEM FROM Final Answer from previous agent MUST BE MAPPED
    - DO NOT USE GENERIC OR PREVIOUS MAPPINGS
    - IF NO DIRECT MATCH EXISTS, CREATE A "Suggested_new_functional_item"

    DETAILED MAPPING INSTRUCTIONS:

    1. REVIEW OF FUNCTIONAL ITEMS:
    - Analyze each item from knowledge_sources
    - Understand the precise functional characteristics

    2. COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF Final Answer from previous agent ANSWER:
    - Carefully review EACH component
    - Understand precise functional characteristics
    - Fill the "functional_components_mapped" array with the exact hierarchy of the component

    3. PRECISE KNOWLEDGE HIERARCHY MATCHING:
    - Match EACH Final Answer from previous agent functional_item, and fill the field "functional_components_mapped" with the following hierarchy:
        - "nature_of_operation"
        - "main_category"
        - "functional_component"
        - "functional_item" (could be more than one)
    

    4. RIGOROUS VALIDATION CHECKLIST:
    - Confirm each nature-category-component exists in knowledge_sources
    - Preserve ALL original Final Answer from previous agent properties, except "functional_components_mapped"
    - You have to fill the "functional_components_mapped" array with de mapping of the functional item to the knowledge_sources
